[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openservicebrokerapi/osb-checker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openservicebrokerapi/osb-checker "Travis")

# osb-checker

An automatic checker to verify an Open Service Broker API implementation against the [specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker).

# Project Status

This project should be considered **experimental**. You should validate the results against the released [specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker). In the case of any discrepancy, the specification should be considered correct.

# Usage

## The Mock OSBAPI Server

This repository comes with a mock OSBAPI compatible server. Follow the steps
below to start the mock server and run tests against it.

1. Run `git clone` to clone this repository to `$DIRECTORY`

2. Build and launch the mock server

```bash
cd $DIRECTORY && make
cd $DIRECTORY/$VERSION_NUMBER/mocks && node mockOSB.js
```

Or you can build mock server docker image and run containerized mock server.

```bash
cd $DIRECTORY && make docker
docker run -d --net=host osb-checker/mock-broker:2.13
```

3. In a new terminal window, run the tests

```bash
cd $DIRECTORY/$VERSION_NUMBER/tests/test && npm test
```

If you have built docker image, then you can run this command:

```bash
docker run -it --net=host osb-checker/test-job:2.13
```

## Your own OSBAPI Endpoint

Follow the below instructions to run tests against your own OSBAPI
compatible server.

1. Modify test configurations. By default, test parameters are loaded from the
   `test\config_mock.json` file so that you can run tests directly against the mock
   server. For your own environment, you should create a new config file based on
   `test\config_mock.json` and fill in your OSB endpoint info:

```json
"url": "<your OSB endpoint>",
"apiVersion" : "<OSB API version number>",
"user": "<your user name>",
"password": "<your password>",
"authentication": "basic",
"caCertFile": "<path to ca-cert (optional)>",
```

If your server uses TLS with an untrusted certificate authority, specify the
path to the CA certificate using the `caCertFile` property.

2. Modify your test configuration file to use match with your environment,
   such as using the correct service ids and plan ids. OSB-Checker is data-driven.
   You can define more test cases by modifying the test configuration file.
   For instance, to add a new service instance provision case, simply add a new
   item into the `provisions` array.

> **CALL TO ACTION** Please contribute your test configurations back to the community.

3. Update **test.js** to use your own configuration:

```javascript
var config = require("./configs/config_mock.json"); //replace config_mock.json with your own configuration file
```

4. Run tests

```bash
    cd $DIRECTORY/$VERSION_NUMBER/tests/test && npm test
```

# What's Covered

The following functionality is covered by the tests:

* OSBAPI 2.13
  * All OSBAPI 2.13 verbs (~60 test cases)
  * JSON schema check against all requests/responses (7 schemas)
  * JSON schema check if OSBAPI returns schemas for parameters
  * Extensible test cases by configuration files

# Customize

### Provisioning requests

Provisioning requests are configured by the **provisions** array in your test configuration file. You can modify the array to use different _service_ids_ and _plan_ids_. You can specify _instance_id_. If you leave the field as an empty string, a random instance id will be used during tests.
Provision requests support a couple of different scenarios, driven by the "scenario" property:

* **new** check for provisioning a new service instance
* **conflict** check for service instance conflicts. To set this up, you need two provision requests with the same _instance_id_ but different _plan_id_ or _service_id_, with the first request marked as **new** and the second request marked as **conflict**. Please see the **EXISTING_ID** requests in **configs/config_mock.json** as an example.

## Mock OSBAPI Endpoint

OSB Checker also comes with a mock OSBAPI server that can be used to test marketplace implementations. To launch the Mock server:

```bash
    cd $DIRECTORY/$VERSION_NUMBER/mocks && npm install
    node mockOSB.js
```
